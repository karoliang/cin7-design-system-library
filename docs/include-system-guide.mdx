# Include System Guide

<Lede>
A revolutionary approach to component development that lets you declare components across multiple frameworks using a unified syntax. Stop thinking about frameworks and start thinking about components.
</Lede>

The Cin7 DSL Include System transforms how you work with components. Instead of worrying about which framework a component comes from, you simply declare what you need using our intuitive include syntax.

## What is the Include System?

The Include System is a framework-agnostic way to declare and use components across all layers of the Cin7 DSL framework. It allows you to mix and match components from React, ExtJS, Vanilla JavaScript, and TypeScript using a single, consistent syntax.

### The Problem We Solve

**Before** (Traditional approach):
```typescript
// Multiple imports from different frameworks
import {Card, Button} from '@shopify/polaris';
import {ExtDataGrid} from '@cin7/extjs-adapters';
import {BadgeComponent} from '@cin7/vanilla-js';
import {ProductRepository} from '@cin7/typescript-sdk';
```

**After** (Include System):
```typescript
// Framework-agnostic component declarations
include "react" "Card" "default"
include "react" "Button" "primary"
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "enterprise"
include "vanilla" "Badge" "success"
include "typescript" "ProductRepository" "standard"
```

## Enhanced Features (v2.0+)

The include system has been enhanced with advanced features for enterprise development:

### Design Token Support
Configure components with design tokens for consistent theming:

```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default" {
  designTokens: {
    theme: "dark",
    spacing: "loose",
    elevation: "medium",
    colorScheme: "brand"
  }
}
```

### Type-Safe Builder Pattern
Get full IntelliSense support and compile-time safety:

```typescript
import { createTypedIncludeBuilder, DesignTokens } from '@cin7/include-system';

const builder = createTypedIncludeBuilder({
  designTokens: { theme: "light", spacing: "base" }
});

// Type-safe includes with autocomplete
const includes = [
  builder.react.Card.default({
    designTokens: DesignTokens.brand,
    responsive: {
      small: { size: "small" },
      large: { size: "large" }
    }
  }),
  builder.react.Button.primary({
    designTokens: Presets.primaryButton
  })
];
```

### Theme System Integration
Built-in theme support for light, dark, brand, and neutral themes:

```typescript
// Theme presets
include "react" "Page" "dashboard" {
  designTokens: {
    theme: "dark",
    spacing: "base",
    size: "medium"
  }
}
```

### Responsive Design Support
Configure components for different screen sizes:

```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default" {
  responsive: {
    small: { size: "small", spacing: "tight" },
    medium: { size: "medium", spacing: "base" },
    large: { size: "large", spacing: "loose" }
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Features
Built-in accessibility configuration:

```typescript
include "react" "Button" "primary" {
  accessibility: {
    ariaLabel: "Submit form",
    describedBy: "form-instructions",
    role: "button"
  }
}
```

## Basic Syntax

The include system uses a simple, declarative syntax:

```
include "<language>" "<component>" "<variation>"
```

### Parameters

- **language**: The framework/language (`react`, `vanilla`, `extjs`, `typescript`)
- **component**: The component name (`Card`, `Button`, `DataGrid`, etc.)
- **variation**: The specific variant (`default`, `small`, `primary`, `enterprise`, etc.)

## Supported Languages

### React Components
```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default"
include "react" "Button" "primary"
include "react" "MediaCard" "video-card"
include "react" "Badge" "success"
```

### Vanilla JavaScript Components
```typescript
include "vanilla" "Card" "default"
include "vanilla" "Button" "primary"
include "vanilla" "Badge" "success"
include "vanilla" "Modal" "default"
```

### ExtJS Components
```typescript
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "enterprise"
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "abc"
include "extjs" "FormPanel" "standard"
include "extjs" "TreeGrid" "hierarchical"
```

### TypeScript Patterns
```typescript
include "typescript" "Repository" "standard"
include "typescript" "UseCase" "crud"
include "typescript" "Specification" "query"
include "typescript" "EventBus" "typed"
```

## Component documentation integration

Every component example in the design system docs now exposes a dedicated **Include snippets** panel. The panel renders live include statements for React, Vanilla, ExtJS, and TypeScript, and automatically falls back to placeholder copy when a language has not been wired up yet.

Under the hood:

- `pnpm collect:variations` parses MDX frontmatter and emits two artefacts:
  - `polaris/polaris.shopify.com/generated/component-variations.json` powers the docs site
  - `packages/include-system/src/generated/componentVariations.ts` feeds the include registry and tests
- The include registry (`@cin7/include-system`) auto-registers every component/variation pair, so Include System lookups stay in sync with the docs.
- A Jest coverage check (`packages/include-system/src/__tests__/registryCoverage.test.ts`) guards against missing mappings across all four languages.

When adding or editing docs examples:

1. Run `pnpm collect:variations` to refresh the dataset files.
2. Update or extend the include registry if a new component or variation appears.
3. Re-run `pnpm --filter @cin7/include-system test` to confirm coverage.
4. Inspect the component page locally to ensure the Include snippets panel renders as expected.

## Real-World Examples

### Mixed Framework Page
Here's how you can create a complex page using components from different frameworks:

```typescript
// Page wrapper
include "react" "Page" "full-width"

// Header section
include "react" "Card" "header"
include "vanilla" "Badge" "new-feature"

// Main content area
include "react" "Grid" "two-column"

// Left column
include "react" "Card" "product-info"
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "product-inventory"

// Right column
include "react" "Form" "product-edit"
include "vanilla" "ButtonGroup" "actions"
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "category-selector"

// Footer
include "vanilla" "Toast" "notification"
include "typescript" "EventBus" "page-events"
```

### Dashboard Example
```typescript
// Dashboard layout
include "react" "Page" "dashboard"

// Metrics cards
include "react" "Card" "metric-card"  // 4x
include "vanilla" "Badge" "trend-indicator"  // 4x

// Main data table
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "sales-data"
include "vanilla" "Spinner" "loading"

// Filters and controls
include "react" "Form" "filters"
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "date-range"
include "vanilla" "Button" "export"

// State management
include "typescript" "Repository" "sales-data"
include "typescript" "UseCase" "filter-sales"
```

## Component Variations

Each component in the include system supports multiple variations to handle different use cases:

### Card Variations
```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default"        // Standard card
include "react" "Card" "header"         // Header card
include "react" "Card" "product-info"   // Product information
include "react" "Card" "metric-card"    // Metrics display
include "vanilla" "Card" "simple"       // Lightweight card
```

### Button Variations
```typescript
include "react" "Button" "primary"      // Primary action
include "react" "Button" "secondary"    // Secondary action
include "react" "Button" "destructive"  // Destructive action
include "vanilla" "Button" "link"       // Link-style button
include "extjs" "Button" "toolbar"      // Toolbar button
```

### Badge Variations
```typescript
include "react" "Badge" "success"       // Success indicator
include "react" "Badge" "warning"       // Warning indicator
include "react" "Badge" "info"          // Info indicator
include "vanilla" "Badge" "new"         // New feature badge
include "vanilla" "Badge" "trend-up"    // Trend indicator
```

## Available Components

### Layout Components
- **Page**: Page layouts (`full-width`, `dashboard`, `settings`)
- **Card**: Content containers (`default`, `header`, `product-info`, `metric-card`)
- **Grid**: Layout grids (`two-column`, `three-column`, `responsive`)
- **Divider**: Visual separators (`horizontal`, `vertical`)

### Navigation Components
- **Tabs**: Tab navigation (`default`, `pills`, `vertical`)
- **Link**: Navigation links (`default`, `back`, `external`)
- **Pagination**: Page navigation (`default`, `compact`)

### Form Components
- **Form**: Form containers (`default`, `settings`, `filters`)
- **TextField**: Text input (`default`, `multiline`, `search`)
- **Select**: Dropdown selection (`default`, `multi-select`, `searchable`)
- **ComboBox**: Enhanced dropdown (`default`, `abc`, `xyz`)

### Data Display Components
- **DataGrid**: Data tables (`enterprise`, `standard`, `compact`)
- **Badge**: Status indicators (`success`, `warning`, `info`, `new`)
- **Avatar**: User avatars (`default`, `small`, `large`)
- **MediaCard**: Media content (`default`, `video-card`, `portrait-video-card`)

### Feedback Components
- **Spinner**: Loading indicators (`default`, `small`, `large`)
- **Toast**: Notifications (`default`, `success`, `error`)
- **Banner**: Page alerts (`info`, `warning`, `critical`)
- **Modal**: Dialog boxes (`default`, `confirmation`, `custom`)

## How It Works

### 1. Declaration
When you write an include statement, you're declaring what you need:

```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default"
```

### 2. Resolution
The include system resolves this to the appropriate implementation:

```typescript
// Generated automatically
import {Card} from '@cin7/polaris-adapter';
```

### 3. Registration
All components are registered in a global registry that tracks:
- Available frameworks
- Component variations
- Dependencies and relationships
- Import paths and configurations

### 4. Code Generation
The system generates the appropriate import statements and configurations based on your declarations.

## Migration Guide

### From Traditional Imports

**Step 1: Identify your current imports**
```typescript
import {Card, Button} from '@shopify/polaris';
import {ExtDataGrid} from '@cin7/extjs-adapters';
import {BadgeComponent} from '@cin7/vanilla-js';
```

**Step 2: Replace with include statements**
```typescript
include "react" "Card" "default"
include "react" "Button" "primary"
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "enterprise"
include "vanilla" "Badge" "success"
```

**Step 3: Remove import statements**
The include system handles all imports automatically.

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Framework Agnostic**: Focus on components, not frameworks
2. **Unified Syntax**: Single approach across all Cin7 DSL layers
3. **Auto-completion**: Better IDE support with component discovery
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all includes
5. **Future Proof**: Easy to add new frameworks and components

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Includes
```typescript
// Based on user permissions
include "extjs" "DataGrid" hasAdmin ? "admin" : "readonly"

// Based on device type
include "vanilla" "Card" isMobile ? "compact" : "default"
```

### Dynamic Includes
```typescript
// From configuration
const componentConfig = {
  header: {framework: "react", component: "Card", variation: "header"},
  table: {framework: "extjs", component: "DataGrid", variation: "enterprise"}
};

// Generate includes dynamically
Object.values(componentConfig).forEach(({framework, component, variation}) => {
  include `${framework}` `${component}` `${variation}`;
});
```

### Custom Component Registration
```typescript
// Register custom components
registerComponent("custom", "MyWidget", {
  react: {path: "./widgets/MyWidget.tsx", variations: ["default", "mini"]},
  vanilla: {path: "./widgets/MyWidget.js", variations: ["default"]}
});

// Use custom components
include "custom" "MyWidget" "default"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Variations
```typescript
// Good: Specific variation
include "react" "Button" "primary"

// Avoid: Generic default when specific is better
include "react" "Button" "default"
```

### 2. Group Related Includes
```typescript
// Group includes by purpose
// Layout
include "react" "Page" "dashboard"
include "react" "Grid" "two-column"

// Data
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "sales-data"
include "vanilla" "Spinner" "loading"

// Actions
include "react" "Button" "primary"
include "vanilla" "Toast" "notification"
```

### 3. Consider Framework Strengths
```typescript
// Use React for UI components
include "react" "Card" "default"
include "react" "Button" "primary"

// Use ExtJS for data-heavy components
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "enterprise"
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "search"

// Use Vanilla JS for lightweight interactions
include "vanilla" "Badge" "success"
include "vanilla" "Spinner" "small"
```

### 4. Leverage TypeScript for Business Logic
```typescript
// Use TypeScript patterns for data and business logic
include "typescript" "Repository" "product"
include "typescript" "UseCase" "order-management"
include "typescript" "EventBus" "typed"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Component not found
```typescript
// Error: Component "DataGrid" not found in framework "vanilla"
include "vanilla" "DataGrid" "default"  // DataGrid is only available in extjs
```

**Solution**: Use the correct framework for the component
```typescript
include "extjs" "DataGrid" "default"  // Correct
```

**Issue**: Variation not supported
```typescript
// Error: Variation "abc" not found for component "Button" in framework "react"
include "react" "Button" "abc"
```

**Solution**: Check available variations
```typescript
include "react" "Button" "primary"  // Correct
```

**Issue**: Missing dependencies
```typescript
// Error: Component "ComboBox" requires additional setup
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "abc"
```

**Solution**: Include required dependencies
```typescript
include "extjs" "Store" "local"      // Required for ComboBox
include "extjs" "ComboBox" "abc"
```

### Debugging Includes

Use the include system debugger to trace resolutions:

```typescript
// Enable debug mode
debugIncludes(true);

// Check component availability
isAvailable("react", "Card", "default"); // true
isAvailable("vanilla", "DataGrid", "default"); // false

// List all variations for a component
listVariations("react", "Button"); // ["primary", "secondary", "destructive"]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization
The include system automatically:
- Tree-shakes unused components
- Splits bundles by framework
- Loads components on-demand when possible

### Runtime Performance
- Component resolution happens at build time
- No runtime overhead for includes
- Framework-specific optimizations applied automatically

## Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Replace a few imports with includes to understand the system
2. **Explore Components**: Browse the component registry to discover available options
3. **Build Mixed Pages**: Try combining components from different frameworks
4. **Custom Components**: Register your own components in the include system
