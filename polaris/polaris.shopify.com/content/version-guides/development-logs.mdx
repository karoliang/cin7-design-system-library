## July 15, 2025 - Production Stability

### Critical TypeScript Build Fix

**5b50d9a** - `fix: Restore working codeVariants.ts with proper exports`

**Why this change mattered:**
The TypeScript build system encountered over 9,000 errors due to malformed template literals in the codeVariants.ts file. This single file contained all code examples for the documentation site, making it critical for deployment.

**Technical approach:**
- Identified that manual edits had corrupted template literal syntax
- Restored the file from a known working commit (db833e2)
- Added the missing `getCodeExamples` function that components required
- Validated all 762 documentation pages built successfully

**Impact:**
This fix unblocked the entire documentation deployment pipeline, allowing the framework to reach production users.

## July 14, 2025 - Developer Feedback Implementation

### The Vanilla JavaScript Component Revolution

**The challenge:**
Developers working with the framework provided critical feedback about the vanilla JavaScript layer. They found the `polaris-` prefixed CSS classes confusing and wanted a more programmatic API similar to traditional component libraries.

**Key developer feedback:**
> "Drop polaris- prefix from CSS and build reusable Vanilla JS components with label, callbacks, get/set methods, and setDisabled"

### Implementation Details

**9a8cd8f** - `feat: Add complete component library files and documentation`

**What changed:**
- Added comprehensive CSS files for all component variations
- Ensured complete documentation coverage for every component
- Fixed module resolution issues across the framework

**c05207c** - `feat: Implement complete vanilla JS component system based on developer feedback`

**The transformation:**
This commit represents a fundamental shift in how developers interact with the vanilla JavaScript layer. Instead of manipulating HTML strings with CSS classes, developers now have a proper component API:

```javascript
// Before: HTML string manipulation
const checkbox = `<label class="polaris-checkbox">
  <input type="checkbox" class="polaris-checkbox__input">
  <span class="polaris-checkbox__label">I agree</span>
</label>`;

// After: Component-based API
const checkbox = new CheckboxComponent({
  label: 'I agree to the terms',
  onCheck: () => console.log('User agreed'),
  onUncheck: () => console.log('User disagreed')
});

checkbox.mount('#app');
checkbox.setDisabled(false);
const isChecked = checkbox.get(); // returns boolean
```

**Technical achievements:**
- Removed over 500 instances of `polaris-` prefixes from CSS classes
- Created a base `Component` class with consistent lifecycle methods
- Implemented 80+ component classes with uniform APIs
- Added event callbacks for all interactive components
- Provided getter/setter methods for all component values
- Ensured all components support disabled states

**Impact on developer experience:**
This change transformed the vanilla JavaScript layer from a documentation reference into a fully functional component library, matching developer expectations from frameworks like jQuery UI or Bootstrap JavaScript.
