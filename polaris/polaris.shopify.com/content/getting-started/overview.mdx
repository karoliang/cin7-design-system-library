## What is Cin7 DSL?

Cin7 DSL (Design System Language) is a comprehensive framework that provides a layered approach to building enterprise applications. Unlike traditional single-framework solutions, Cin7 DSL embraces the philosophy of using the right tool for each layer of your application:

- **Design Foundation**: Built on Shopify Polaris design tokens, components, and patterns
- **Multi-Technology Approach**: Leverages Vanilla JS, TypeScript, React, and ExtJS where each excels
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between design system, UI interactions, components, and business logic
- **Enterprise Focus**: Designed for complex, data-intensive business applications

### The Four Layers of Cin7 DSL

1. **Design System Layer** - Polaris foundation for consistent visual language
2. **UI Interaction Layer** - Vanilla JavaScript for lightweight, performant interactions
3. **Component Layer** - React + ExtJS for reusable UI components
4. **Application Layer** - TypeScript for type-safe business logic

### Current Implementation Status

The Cin7 DSL framework is fully implemented with the following packages:

- ✅ **@cin7/core**: Core utilities usable across all layers
- ✅ **@cin7/polaris-adapter**: React components with Polaris integration
- ✅ **@cin7/vanilla-js**: Lightweight UI interaction utilities
- ✅ **@cin7/typescript-sdk**: Business logic patterns and utilities
- ✅ **@cin7/extjs-adapters**: ExtJS component integration
- ✅ **@cin7/design-tokens**: Extended design token system
- ✅ **@cin7/cli**: Command-line interface for scaffolding and development

## Key Features

### Design System Base
- **Polaris Foundation**: Leverages Shopify's battle-tested design system
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, typography, and layout patterns
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with accessibility built-in
- **Icon Library**: 400+ carefully crafted icons for enterprise applications

### Technology Stack

Cin7 DSL uses different technologies for different purposes:

#### UI Interaction Layer
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Direct DOM manipulation for performance-critical operations
- **Event Systems**: Lightweight event handling without framework overhead
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build up from a solid, framework-free foundation

#### Component Layer  
- **React**: Component composition and modern UI patterns
- **ExtJS Integration**: Advanced form controls, data grids, and complex UI widgets
- **Polaris Components**: Beautiful, accessible UI building blocks

#### Application Layer
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe business logic and application state management
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **API Integration**: Type-safe API clients and data transformation

#### Build Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development experience with HMR
- **pnpm Workspaces**: Monorepo management for modular architecture
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time type checking across all layers

### Architecture Benefits
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between design system, business logic, and UI interactions
- **Scalability**: Component-based architecture that grows with your application
- **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns and conventions across the entire codebase
- **Developer Productivity**: Comprehensive tooling and documentation
