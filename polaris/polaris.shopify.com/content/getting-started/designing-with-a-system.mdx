At Cin7, we often say, "Cin7 DSL is the foundation, not the limitation." The design system provides you with building blocks from both Polaris and ExtJS, and it's up to you to construct them in a way that best meets your enterprise users' needs. The idea behind Cin7 DSL not being a limitation is that you shouldn't constrain your solutions to existing patterns too early. Zoom out, figure out the best design solution to the problem, and then see if Cin7 DSL has all the pieces for you to implement that solution. If there's a gap, then [contribute](mailto:karo.liang@cin7.com) to the system to make it better.

## Choosing the Right Tool

Cin7 DSL provides multiple layers of components:

### Polaris Components
Use for:
- Standard UI elements (buttons, cards, modals)
- Simple forms and inputs
- Navigation and layout
- Feedback and messaging

### ExtJS Components
Use for:
- Complex data grids with advanced features
- Enterprise form controls with validation
- Large dataset handling
- Export and reporting functionality

### Vanilla JavaScript
Use for:
- Performance-critical operations
- Browser API interactions
- Lightweight utilities
- Custom animations

### TypeScript
Use for:
- Business logic implementation
- Type-safe data models
- Complex state management
- API integrations

## Zoom out

No matter what problem you're solving, zooming out allows you to get a better understanding of the problem, and its sphere of influence. A problem rarely exists in isolation, so understanding context and contributing factors is key before getting into solutions. Practically speaking, this means that you should understand the enterprise application as a whole, not just the module you're working on.

For instance, if you work on inventory management, you should have a holistic understanding of the entire ERP system so you can leverage existing patterns and mental models. You can also gain context and empathy for users through research.

Enterprise users don't care about technical boundaries. They use the application as a whole, so we must design with the whole experience in mind.

## Explore freely

When you understand the application as a whole, you should be well equipped to explore without constraints. That means don't start from our component library or patterns you see in the product---start with the user's workflow instead. Solve the problem, preferably in more than one way, before you start worrying about implementation.

Consider:
- **Data complexity**: Will users work with large datasets?
- **Performance needs**: Are real-time updates required?
- **Integration points**: How does this interact with other systems?
- **User expertise**: Are users power users or occasional users?

## Calibrate

Once you understand the problem and potential solutions, you can start aligning more closely with the design system.

### Integration Patterns

1. **Polaris-First Approach**
   - Start with Polaris components for the UI
   - Add ExtJS only where advanced functionality is needed
   - Use TypeScript for business logic

2. **Data-First Approach**
   - Begin with ExtJS grids for data-heavy interfaces
   - Wrap with Polaris layout components
   - Add Vanilla JS for performance optimization

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Mix Polaris and ExtJS components as needed
   - Use adapter components for seamless integration
   - Leverage TypeScript for type safety across frameworks

## Enterprise Considerations

When building with Cin7 DSL, always consider:

- **Scalability**: Will this solution work with 10x the data?
- **Performance**: How does it perform with thousands of records?
- **Accessibility**: Are keyboard shortcuts and screen readers supported?
- **Internationalization**: Can it handle multiple languages and locales?
- **Integration**: How does it connect with other enterprise systems?

## Contributing Back

If you identify gaps or opportunities for improvement:

1. Document the use case and requirements
2. Propose a solution that fits the Cin7 DSL architecture
3. Consider both Polaris and ExtJS integration points
4. [Contact us](mailto:karo.liang@cin7.com) to discuss your contribution

Remember: Every enterprise has unique needs, but many patterns are universal. By contributing back to Cin7 DSL, you help build a stronger foundation for all enterprise applications.
