## Development Resources

The Cin7 DSL framework provides multiple layers of functionality:

### Core Components
- **Polaris Foundation**: Base components, design tokens, and accessibility
- **React Components**: Modern component library with TypeScript support
- **ExtJS Integration**: Advanced form controls, data grids, and visualization
- **Build Tools**: Optimized development and production workflows

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Create new Cin7 DSL project
npx @cin7/create-dsl-app my-app

# Or add to existing project
npm install @cin7/dsl-core @cin7/dsl-components
```

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with layered architecture
- **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Performance Optimized**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient bundling
- **Enterprise Ready**: Advanced data handling with ExtJS integration
- **Accessibility**: Built-in WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

## Development Workflow

### 1. Set Up Environment
Start with our [development setup guide](/getting-started/development) to configure your local environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.

### 2. Understand Architecture
Review the [architecture documentation](/getting-started/architecture) to understand how different layers work together and follow established patterns.

### 3. Build Components
Use Polaris components as your foundation, then enhance with ExtJS components for advanced functionality like data grids and complex forms.

### 4. State Management
Implement state management using Zustand for application state and React Query for server state management.

## Integration Patterns

### Basic UI Components
```tsx
import { Card, Stack, Text, Button } from '@shopify/polaris';

const UserCard = ({ user }) => (
  <Card>
    <Stack vertical>
      <Text variant="headingMd">{user.name}</Text>
      <Text color="subdued">{user.email}</Text>
      <Button onClick={() => editUser(user)}>Edit</Button>
    </Stack>
  </Card>
);
```

### Advanced Data Components
```tsx
import { ExtDataGrid } from '@cin7/dsl-extjs-adapters';

const UserGrid = ({ users }) => (
  <ExtDataGrid
    data={users}
    columns={[
      { text: 'Name', dataIndex: 'name', flex: 1 },
      { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email', flex: 1 },
      { text: 'Role', dataIndex: 'role', width: 120 }
    ]}
    features={['sorting', 'filtering', 'export']}
  />
);
```
