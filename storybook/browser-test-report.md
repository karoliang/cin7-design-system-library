# Storybook Browser Testing Report

## Test Results
- **Date**: 2025-11-05T19:13:08.985Z
- **URL**: http://localhost:6006
- **Method**: System browser testing

## Findings

### HTTP Server Test
✅ Server is responding to requests

### Content Analysis
- Page content is being served
- HTML structure is present
- React/Storybook scripts are loading

### Visual Testing
- Screenshots captured for visual verification
- Browser window opens successfully

## Console Error Analysis

Based on the user's reports and our testing:
1. **HTTP 500 errors** for index.json suggest server-side processing issues
2. **404 errors** for favicon.svg indicate missing static assets
3. **Loading indicators** suggest React app mounting issues

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be:
1. Storybook server responds to HTTP requests
2. But the React application fails to mount properly
3. This creates a "stuck loading" state where the UI never renders

## Recommendations

1. **Check Storybook build process**: Ensure stories are compiled correctly
2. **Verify module resolution**: Check for import/export issues in story files
3. **Test with minimal setup**: Try with a single simple story
4. **Check browser console**: Look for specific JavaScript errors
5. **Verify dependencies**: Ensure all Storybook and React packages are compatible

## Next Steps

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check Console tab
2. Look for red error messages
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Examine Elements tab for DOM structure
