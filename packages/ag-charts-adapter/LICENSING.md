**For commercial, government, or proprietary use, you must purchase a Highcharts license.**

## License Verification

After purchasing a Highcharts license:

  // Your license configuration
});
```

## For Non-Commercial Use

You can use Highcharts under their CC BY-NC 3.0 license without purchasing a commercial license.
